###I have used binary exponentation to reduce the running time rather than running in O(n) this code runs in O(logn)
This is a very famous trick where the exponent i.e. n here is breaked in multiples of 2.
for example n= 11 can be writen as n = 2^3+2^1+2^0
I have used the same concept in my binpow function and handled the negative values accordingly.
